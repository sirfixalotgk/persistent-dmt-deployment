## Clone

**Important!** Make sure you clone this repo with the `--recursive` flag since it uses git submodules.

To clone live, in-development code (main branch):

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/device-management-toolkit/cloud-deployment.git
```

Alternatively, for steps to clone and Get Started with one of the tagged releases, [see our documentation][docs].

## Get Started

There are multiple options to quickly deploy the Open AMT Cloud Toolkit:

### Option 1: Local using Docker

The quickest and easiest option is to set up a local stack using Docker, view our [Documentation Site][docs] and click the Get Started tab for How-To steps and examples.

### Option 2: Cloud using Azure

For more experienced users, deploy the stack on Azure using the 'Deploy to Azure' button below.

> Note: This requires MPS, RPS, and Sample Web UI images to be built and accessible in a Container Image Registry such as Azure Container Registry (ACR), Docker Hub, or other options.

Optionally, deploy from AzureCLI using the following commands:

```bash
az group create --name openamt --location eastus
az deployment group create --resource-group openamt --template-file azureDeploy.json
```


Additional deployments, such as Kubernetes via Azure (AKS) or AWS (EKS), can be found in our [Documentation Site][docs].
